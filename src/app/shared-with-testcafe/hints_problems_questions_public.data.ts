/* Idea:  2019-11-19: Hints/problems could be contextual, e.g. morning, evening, weekend, etc. And appear at the right moment.

  2019-12-25 TODO: !!! contexts (e.g. "Context: Time: after waking up", "Context: before sitting down to work"), habits, order of hints 1. 2. 3. ...
  - to avoid overwhelm (what should I really do now) - get the right advice in the right context and the right order
  - distinguish between "at given time" context from "to improve X" - e.g. "after getting up from bed", vs "to improve getting up from bed" (which could involve activities e.g. in the evening before)
 */

/* 2019-12-25 Self-rating would be really important for actual accountability and force myself to really evaluate current state and what are weakest/strongest points */
